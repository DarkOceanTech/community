# Enjoy my ChronLog

What's going on everyone,

My name is Alex, and this is sort of like my personal blog, the Chronicle Logging. It will be a digital journal, full of notes that I have in from various places such as physical notebooks, sticky notes, reMarkable, all kinds of Microsoft Word docs, Excel spreadsheets, and a few more places. I’ve collected enough throughout the years that I wanted to consolidate before continuing.

I was going to do this privately in Azure DevOps using a project Wiki, but I decided to make it public. For one, the notes I started were already in .mdx and I’m using Nextra. Two, I will add some of my own thoughts on various subjects that I’m interested in. So, if you see something worth scrutinizing, then please, holla at your boy. You can find me on X.

This is truly a data dump of my personal work. Some of my interests I will add include learning techniques, various aspects of health, human origins, ancient technologies, space exploration, and of course, aliens.

I hope I add a little value to your life through these series of research projects and personal notes.

Take care,

Alex

# **BlogKeeper**

Just as a bookkeeper takes care of your accounting data, BlogKeeper is designed to take care of you by keeping up with industry news, federal regulation, local state policies, and new accounting technologies to increase your chances of success.

BlogKeeper focuses on creating actionable insights tailored to new, small, and medium sized businesses. The idea is creating a recourse library that improves the bookkeeper and business owner relationship. Accounting staff and your business operators must synchronize communication and terminology. Synchronization is achieved with a system of asynchronous learning. BlogKeeper is our attempt to do just that.

Although we focus on people that bring love and joy to the world through various forms of art, service-based businesses that help with everyday tasks that people don't want to do, and real estate investors that provide infrastructure, we hope to be of use to all of humanity... or at least our small corner of it.
